## 🛰️ What is this?

SpaceChips' Website —  
a digital identity that doesn’t talk much,  
but tries to mean what it says.

## 🧠 What's inside?

- No cookies  
- No ads  
- No trackers  
- No machine-learning on your thoughts (yet)

Just a few words, a logo, and a way to reach me.  
You’re safe here. Probably.
